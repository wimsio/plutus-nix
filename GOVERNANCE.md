# Governance

## Scope
This repository provides Nix + Cabal onboarding and example Plutus projects.

## Decision making
- Small decisions: maintainer can merge after review.
- Bigger changes (structure, tooling, releases): discuss in GitHub Discussions first.

## Releases
- Use SemVer tags: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- Update CHANGELOG.md before tagging
